## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Use Authentication**: Set `FARAMESH_TOKEN` in production
3. **Secure Policies**: Protect policy files with proper permissions
4. **Database Security**: Use strong passwords and secure connections for PostgreSQL
5. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS in production, restrict network access
6. **Regular Audits**: Review policies and approval decisions regularly

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit tokens or passwords
3. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Security Reviews**: Review code for security issues
5. **Follow Guidelines**: Follow security guardrails in [SECURITY-GUARDRAILS.md](docs/SECURITY-GUARDRAILS.md)

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Rate Limiting**: Faramesh doesn't implement rate limiting. Use a reverse proxy (nginx) or API gateway for rate limiting in production.

2. **Policy File Security**: Policy files are not encrypted. Protect with file system permissions.

3. **Input Encryption**: Inputs are not encrypted at rest. Use database encryption for sensitive data.

4. **Shell Command Execution**: If executors use `shell=True`, command sanitization is best-effort. Real security comes from approval workflows.

5. **Single Policy File**: Currently uses a single policy file. Multi-file policies may be added in the future.

### Security Features

1. **Deny-by-Default**: Actions are denied unless explicitly allowed
2. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Command Sanitization**: Shell commands are sanitized
4. **No Side Effects Until Approval**: Policy evaluation has no side effects
5. **Optimistic Locking**: Prevents race conditions
6. **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication supported

See [Security Guardrails](docs/SECURITY-GUARDRAILS.md) for detailed security mechanisms.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 0.2.0 → 0.2.1)
- Documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- Announced via GitHub Security Advisories

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Report vulnerabilities privately
2. **No Public Disclosure**: Don't disclose publicly until fixed
3. **Coordination**: We'll coordinate disclosure timing
4. **Credit**: We'll credit you in security advisories (if desired)
